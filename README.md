I study environmental and anthropogenic drivers of community occupancy of arboreal and terrestrial mesomammals in tropical southeast Asia.
My career goals are to increase capacity and develop sustainable community-based conservation initiatives in biodiverse regions with a focus on
human-wildlife conflict, wildlife trade, and deforestation.
